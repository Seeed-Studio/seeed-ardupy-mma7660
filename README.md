# Seeed ArduPy MMA7660 [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/Seeed-Studio/seeed-ardupy-mma7660.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/github/Seeed-Studio/seeed-ardupy-mma7660)

## Introduction

3-Axis Digital Accelerometer is the key part in projects like orientation detection, gesture detection and Motion detection. This 3-Axis Digital Accelerometer(Â±1.5g) is based on Freescale's low power consumption module, MMA7660FC. It features up to 10,000g high shock survivability and configurable Samples per Second rate. For generous applications that don't require too large measurement range, this is a great choice because it's durable, energy saving and cost-efficient.

## How to binding with ArduPy
- Install [AIP](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/ardupy-aip)
- Build firmware with Seeed ArduPy MMA7660
```shell
aip install Seeed-Studio/seeed-ardupy-mma7660
aip build
```
- Flash new firmware to you ArduPy board
```shell
aip flash 
```
For more examples of using AIP, please refer to [AIP](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/ardupy-aip).

## Usage

```python
from arduino import grove_3ada
import time

ada = grove_3ada() # SCL & SDA as the default

while True:
    print (
        "x =", ada.x, ",",
        "y =", ada.y, ",", 
        "z =", ada.z
    )
    print (
        "x-a =", ada.x_acceleration, "g,", 
        "y-a =", ada.y_acceleration, "g,", 
        "z-a =", ada.z_acceleration)
    time.sleep(1)
```

## API Reference

```

- **z** : Get Z-axis value
```python
print(ada.z)
```
- **x_acceleration** : Get X-axis acceleration
 ```python
print(ada.x_acceleration)
```
- **y_acceleration*** : Get Y-axis acceleration
```python
print(ada.y_acceleration)
```
- **z_acceleration*** : Get Z-axis acceleration
```python
print(ada.z_acceleration)
```
